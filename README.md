# OpenDeck for StreamController

A StreamController plugin to trigger actions in OpenDeck

You should install [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController), this StreamController plugin, and [OpenDeck](https://github.com/nekename/OpenDeck) v2.6.0 or newer. You should also enable "Disable Elgato device discovery" within OpenDeck.

You can then select keys in StreamController to be handled by OpenDeck by assigning an 'OpenDeck Button' action to them. You should not switch profiles in OpenDeck, and instead let profile management and switching be handled by StreamController.
